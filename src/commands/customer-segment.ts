**High-level customer definition:** ${highLevelDefinition}
${additionalRefinement ? `**Additional nuance or product context:** ${additionalRefinement}` : ""}

Your output must describe one believable individual‚Äînot a generalized user type. Write with vivid specificity.

### The persona must include the following sections:

1. **Name**: A realistic full name.
2. **Demographics**: Age, location, job title, seniority, and income range.
3. **Psychographics**: Values, interests, and lifestyle‚Äîfocus on motivations, not generic traits.
4. **Pain Points & Frustrations**: Make them emotionally resonant and behaviorally observable. What keeps them stuck?
5. **Contradictions & Tensions**: What makes this person complex or even contradictory? Include at least two (e.g., loves new tools but still takes handwritten notes).
6. **Goals & Motivations**: What are they striving for? Include emotional and practical dimensions.
7. **Buying Behavior**: How do they evaluate, decide, and justify purchases? Include how they research, what turns them off, and what builds trust.
8. **Communication Preferences**: Where and how do they prefer to engage with content or products?
9. **Tech Adoption Style**: Are they an early tinkerer, late pragmatist, reluctant skeptic? Add an example of a recent tool they adopted (or abandoned).
10. **Edge Cases**: At least three specific, unexpected behaviors, tools, or values that make them memorable or unique.
11. **Quote**: Include a quote that summarizes how they think or make decisions.
12. **Day in the Life**: Walk through a weekday with a focus on friction, decisions, missed opportunities, and tool usage.

### Requirements:
- Avoid generic phrases like "tech-savvy", "busy", "values quality", or "likes innovation."
- Include at least one specific complaint they have that others dismiss.
- Show behavioral depth‚Äîwhat do they actually *do*, not just what they *say* they value.
- Format as a **clean, structured Markdown document** with headings and short readable paragraphs.
- This persona should be **directly useful for product development, messaging, UX design, and GTM strategy.**`
