**Product/Service:** ${productIdea}
**Target Customer:** ${targetCustomer}
**Initial Problems Identified:** ${initialProblems}
${additionalContext ? `**Additional Context:** ${additionalContext}` : ""}

### The analysis must include the following sections:

1. **Problem Overview**: A brief summary of the problem space and why it matters
2. **Top 3 Problems (Prioritized)**:
   - **Problem #1**: [Most Critical Problem]
     - Description and impact
     - Why it's the highest priority
     - Evidence of the problem's severity
   - **Problem #2**: [Second Most Critical Problem]
     - Description and impact
     - Why it's the second priority
     - Evidence of the problem's severity
   - **Problem #3**: [Third Most Critical Problem]
     - Description and impact
     - Why it's the third priority
     - Evidence of the problem's severity

3. **Problem Validation**: How to validate these problems with real customers
4. **Problem-Solution Fit**: How your product addresses each problem
5. **Competitive Analysis**: How existing solutions fail to solve these problems
6. **Market Opportunity**: The size and urgency of solving these problems
7. **Next Steps**: Recommended actions to validate and prioritize these problems

### Requirements:
- Focus on problems that are painful, frequent, and urgent
- Include specific examples and evidence where possible
- Prioritize based on customer impact and business opportunity
- Format as a clean, structured Markdown document
- Make each problem actionable and measurable
- Consider both emotional and practical aspects of each problem`
